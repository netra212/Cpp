/*
 * Time and Space Complexity.
 * Time Complexity: It is the total time taken by an algorithm to run as function of length of the input.
 * Big(0)   -> Worse Case Time Complexity -> We always calculate this one Because we always have to prepare for the worse case scenarios.
 * Omega(0) -> Best Case Time Complexity.
 * Theta    -> Average Case Time Complexity.
